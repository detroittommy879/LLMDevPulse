# LLM Analysis of Reddit Posts

**Date Range:** 2025-05-17 to 2025-05-18
**User Question:**
```
List any discussed AI models and what types of tasks people are using them for. Certain models are good for certain things and we are trying to gather data about them. For example, people saying that GPT-4.3 is good for debugging, or o4-mini is great at high level planning, or XYZ-3 is a good balance of low cost and being super good problem solving. Just put the model name no need to put the company name but definitely be specific if there are any variations for a model (like o3, o3-mini, o3-mini-high etc).
Make a list with model-name: then if 3 people mention tool use say 3 people said good for tool use.
newline then next model-name-2: 4 people say it is bad at coding.
So like this:
example-modelname: 5 people are discussing how great it is at agent type coding tasks but 2 people think it isn't good.
example-modelname-2: People discussed trying it for writing documentation but its too early to tell.

```
