#### Notable Child Comment
- **Username**: u/chairman_steel
- **Comment Text**: "It actually can discuss images of topless women, but it draws the line at genitals. I was surprised at how prudish it was, I did a test pulling images from nsfw subreddits to see how it would analyze artistic nudity vs eroticism vs pornography, and it panicked as soon as labia were visible. It had the same issue with a penis so it doesn't appear to be subconscious sexism or anything, just a hard limit on that region of the human body. I didn't try medical diagrams or other medicalized or abstract representations other than a fairly tame hentai image with full frontal nudity. I've had it refuse to generate images like that of even animal reproductive systems before, so I think they're just putting a big censored bar over the entire region of sex rather than risk a 60 Minutes story about a kid being scarred for life by ChatGPT showing him a duck penis or whatever. I do hope they add some kind of age verification system that would allow users to loosen the restrictions a bit. My erotic Sonic the Hedgehog fanfic isn't going to write itself :("

## Project Summary: Reddit LLM Usage Analysis Tool

### Project Objective
This project aims to create a system that analyzes Reddit discussions about AI/LLM tools to extract useful insights about:
1. Which models are most popular for specific coding and creative tasks
2. How user preferences for models evolve over time
3. Task-specific model recommendations based on community experiences
4. Emerging trends in LLM utilization for software development

### Key Data Points to Collect
- **Model mentions**: Detecting references to specific AI models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc.)
- **Task associations**: Linking models with tasks they're used for (coding, debugging, brainstorming, etc.)
- **Sentiment analysis**: Determining if users speak positively or negatively about specific model-task pairings
- **Time trends**: Tracking changes in model popularity over days/weeks/months
- **User reliability**: Identifying power users vs. casual commenters to appropriately weight opinions
- **Post engagement**: Using upvotes, awards, and comment counts as proxies for agreement/importance
- **New model detection**: Automatically identifying discussions about newly released or upcoming models

### Technical Implementation Considerations
- **Database structure**: A normalized SQLite3 database could track:
  - Posts table (id, title, body, date, subreddit, username, upvotes)
  - Comments table (id, parent_id, post_id, body, date, username, upvotes)
  - Models table (id, name, vendor, first_mentioned_date)
  - Tasks table (id, name, category, first_mentioned_date)
  - ModelTasks junction table (model_id, task_id, mention_count, avg_sentiment)

- **NLP Pipeline**:
  1. Text extraction from Reddit API or scraped data
  2. Named entity recognition for model names and versions
  3. Task classification using keyword extraction and context analysis
  4. Sentiment analysis around model-task pairings
  5. Automatic categorization of new models and tasks

- **Visualization Options**:
  - Heatmaps showing model-task suitability
  - Time-series graphs of model popularity
  - Task-specific model recommendation charts
  - Word clouds of terms associated with each model

### User Benefits
- Developers can quickly identify the best tools for specific programming tasks
- Managers can make informed decisions about which AI tools to invest in
- Researchers can track adoption patterns of new LLM technologies
- LLM vendors could potentially use anonymized insights to improve their offerings

### Ethical Considerations
- Need to respect user privacy (even though Reddit is public)
- Should avoid amplifying misinformation or biased opinions
- Important to distinguish between paid promotions and genuine user experiences
- Consider potential for astroturfing or manipulation of results

### Next Steps
- Build a data collection pipeline to gather and store Reddit posts
- Develop NLP models for extracting model mentions, tasks, and sentiments
- Create a simple database schema for storing the processed information
- Implement basic visualization tools to test concept validity
- Consider building an API to allow others to access insights
